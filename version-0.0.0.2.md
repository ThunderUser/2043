[+] Previously, the planets were identical, except that it did not use the same generation materials. Now, we have developed a territory generation system, along with the implementation of biomes, which now generate mountains, lakes, caves, and much more. It is impossible to find 2 identical planets, since they are now generated with a biome system, which allows you to shape the terrain. Each new game you play, you will find that the same planet is different from game to game (⚠ This may change in the future ⚠).
