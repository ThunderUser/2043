[+] The generation of materials has been fixed, previously only diorita was generated.    

-------------------------

12/09/2021 (2):

[+] Previously, the planets were identical, except that it did not use the same generation materials. Now, we have developed a territory generation system, along with the implementation of biomes, which now generate mountains, lakes, caves, and much more. It is impossible to find 2 identical planets, since they are now generated with a biome system, which allows you to shape the terrain. Each new game you play, you will find that the same planet is different from game to game (⚠ This may change in the future ⚠).     
[~] The game was optimized.

[=] Previously, biomes were not generated correctly, and no planet was generated, due to this error. This is now fixed.
